{"question":"What are your latest github projects?","answer":"My latest GitHub projects include a variety of machine learning and web application projects.  For example, I've worked on 'Auto-MPG-Prediction', a web app for predicting auto MPG; 'Banglore_House_Prices', an end-to-end machine learning project for predicting house prices in Bangalore; and 'FlightFarePrediction', a web app for predicting flight fares.  Many other projects focus on various machine learning techniques applied to different datasets (e.g., fraud detection, COVID-19 analysis, and image recognition).  More detailed descriptions of individual projects are available on my GitHub profile.","references":[{"section":"Projects","details":"Multiple projects listed in my portfolio showcase my ability to develop machine learning models and deploy them in web applications."},{"section":"Skills","details":"My skills in Python, machine learning libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), and web development frameworks (React, Django) are evident in the technologies used across these projects."},{"section":"Work Experience","details":"My experience as a Data Science Engineer at PA ATS Yazzoom and Indatacore involved building and deploying machine learning models, aligning with the methodologies demonstrated in my GitHub projects."}]}
